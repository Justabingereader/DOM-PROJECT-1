This is a basic code meant to generate random numbers when clicked. it can go on continuously and has a wide range of numbers that can be generated, some issues were encountered when building this project such as the continuous output of NaN by the project, this turned out to be a pretty easy mistake even tho it took some time to figure out, i as the developer tried out different things such as creating an entirely new element and appending it to the main element, trying out the parseint function in different ways, first by using it directly on the changedText id, the creating a new element and then later parsing it with another element and trying to output that result, the issue was fixed by the simple addition of the () symbol to the math.random function, after that everything was smooth sailing and some minor tweaks were made to the project to make it more understandable.
